# FinalProject_Individual Self Assessment

## Self-Assessment
I am taking the circle role as well as X role during the whole project development; I have drafted the database structure based on each phase we were planning. I have learned the Firebase from our team member - Tanav, and a lots from others. Also, during the project planning and development phases, I am taking the role of making sure that our dreams/plans could be feasibly implemented, and organizing the team meetings and the final presentation, as well as to ensure that our plan could be implemented within the given timelines. I have participated each team discussion and bring ideas and concerns when plans or challenges come.

Juanita (Square role and X role) and Keith always bring fresh ideas and creativities to our team. Juanita shows strong ability on project management and decision making skills, she also connects each segment in the project and make sure there is not missing pieces to the each submission. She takes care each submission preparation and organizes the repository with readme file updated.  

Keith (X role) has done over 50% of the research part. He always brings good ideas and solutions to our challenges; also, he shows strong math skills with resolving the recommendation engine which took us 4 weeks to think through.

Bryan (Triangle role) is our data scientist, and he demonstrated strong knowledge in the ETL and machine learning area. He conducted deep data analysis and built the completed unsupervised model with the accurate result which is the core to our final project to be successful.

Tanav (X role) has done the 100% of navigation part as well as setting up the Firebase on Google cloud. He introduced firebase to our team and takes all technic portion on HTML, JavaScript, PyScrip, Mapquest, Firebase and cloud functions. He has efficient and strong development skills by using different languages and technologies.  He is willing to share knowledge and teach others. He is the valuable and core contributor to our project.

## Team-Assessment

Our team is a great team, every team member pro-actively helps each other and participates our team discussions, as well as bring ideas and solutions to challenges and problems. Every team member contributes what they can do during the project development process. This is a great team I've ever experienced before.

## Summary

Our Final project, Trippr, is a web and mobile application. Trippr collects user information and conducts a survey to gather user's location and personalities then recommend 3 best stops on their trips with applying advanced machine learning technologies and recommendation approaches.

Trippr uses google review data as the training data for the unsupervised model to define users into 4 clusters, and applies recommendation engine by using the random function to decide 3 best categories based on the weighting ratio in each category group, and then conducts place API to fine the 3 best locations around the destination areas.
